# Data-Analytics-Consulting-Internship

This repository contains my work for the KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Internship.

**“The importance of optimising the quality of customer datasets cannot be underestimated. The better the quality of the dataset, the better chance you will be able to use it drive company growth.”**

## Synopsis:
The KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Consulting Internship is a self-paced online program that provides practical experience with real-world datasets and tools commonly used in data analytics. The program includes three modules:

* Data Quality Assessment
* Data Insights
* Data Insights & Presentation

In this internship, I worked on a fictional case study provided by KPMG, in which I was tasked with analyzing customer data and providing insights and recommendations to improve business performance.

The dataset provided contains customer transactions, demographic, and addresses data for a fictitious company 
('Sprocket Central Pty Ltd'. - A medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation).
