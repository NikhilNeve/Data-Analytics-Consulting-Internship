# Data-Analytics-Consulting-Internship

This repository contains my work for the KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Internship.

The KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Consulting Internship is a self-paced online program that provides practical experience with real-world datasets and tools commonly used in data analytics. The program includes three modules:

* Data Quality Assessment
* Data Insights
* Data Insights & Presentation

In this internship, I worked on a fictional case study provided by KPMG, in which I was tasked with analyzing customer data and providing insights and recommendations to improve business performance.
